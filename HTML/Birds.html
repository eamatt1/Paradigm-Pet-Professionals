            <p>Birds, members of the class Aves, are a diverse group that evolved from theropod dinosaurs during the Jurassic period. Characterized by feathers, toothless beaks, and hard-shelled eggs, they have adapted to various ecological niches. There are about 10,000 known bird species, each exhibiting unique behaviors and traits.</p>
