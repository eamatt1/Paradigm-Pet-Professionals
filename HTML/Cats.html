            <h4>Historical Context of Cat Domestication</h4>
            <p>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in Western Asia and have evolved to become the second most popular domestic pet in the United States today. There are over 60 documented cat breeds, each with unique characteristics, but the foundational aspects of care and diet are universally important across all breeds.</p>

            <h4>Developmental Stages and Nutritional Needs</h4>
            <!-- Zero to Four Weeks -->
            <h5>Zero to Four Weeks:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Importance of Nursing:</strong> The queen (a female cat that is pregnant or nursing) directly nursing her kittens is optimal. Monitoring growth rates is essential for proper development.</li>
                <li><strong>Intervention:</strong> If kittens do not grow as expected due to factors such as sibling competition or illness, intervention via bottle or tube feeding may be required.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Four Weeks to One Year -->
            <h5>Four Weeks to One Year:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Introduction to Solid Foods:</strong> At three to four weeks, kittens transition to solid food. It is recommended to introduce wet kitten food gradually, at six to nine ounces per day.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Optimization:</strong> Use foods designed for kittens to provide necessary nutrients for their growth and energy.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- One Year to Seven Years -->
            <h5>One Year to Seven Years:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduced Nutrient Needs:</strong> As cats mature into adulthood, their nutrient requirements decrease.</li>
                <li><strong>Controlled Feeding:</strong> Provide meals at set times to prevent overeating and obesity.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Seven Years and Older -->
            <h5>Seven Years and Older:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Senior Dietary Needs:</strong> Focus on lower fat intake but higher quality protein. Choose foods that specify protein sources (e.g., "salmon" instead of generic "fish").</li>
            </ul>
