        <h4>Overview of Fish Care and Management</h4>
        <p>
            Proper care and management of fish involve maintaining their environment, meeting their dietary needs, and ensuring their health through regular tank maintenance and monitoring.
            <br><strong>Water Environments:</strong> Fish can be categorized into freshwater, saltwater, and brackish water species, each requiring specific water conditions.
            <br><strong>Nutritional Needs:</strong> Fish diets vary by species; typically, they are herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. Feeding should occur twice daily in amounts they can consume in a few minutes.
            <br><strong>Tank Maintenance:</strong> Essential for fish health includes regular water changes (10-20% weekly), effective filtration, and water quality monitoring using appropriate testing kits.
