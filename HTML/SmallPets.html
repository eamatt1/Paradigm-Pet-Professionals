            <p>Consider adopting a small animal such as a hermit crab, mouse, gerbil, hamster, guinea pig, or chinchilla! Depending on which type of animal you adopt, you can provide a comfortable environment using anything from small to large cages or glass aquariums. You must also provide amenities for your new pet, such as bedding or substrate, toys, an exercise wheel, a water dish or drip bottle, a food dish, and grooming equipment. Our “Pexperts” are here to help you decide which pet is right for you and how to provide them with a happy home. Schedule a consultation with us today!</p>

                            Ferrets need a large, secure cage with soft bedding, toys, and tunnels for stimulation. Keep the temperature between 60°F and 70°F. Provide a litter box and supervised playtime in a ferret-proof area. Regular interaction is essential for their well-being.

                            Guinea pigs sleep around 4 to 6 hours daily but do not sleep in long stretches like humans. Instead, they take short naps during the day and at night, usually lasting only a few minutes. They are most active during the early morning and evening hours.

                            Hedgehogs are omnivores and eat insects like mealworms, crickets, and beetles. You can also feed them high-quality commercial hedgehog food, which provides the right balance of nutrients. They can eat small amounts of fruits (like apples and berries) and vegetables (like peas and carrots). Avoid giving them dairy, chocolate, or processed human food, as these can be harmful. Fresh water should always be available.
